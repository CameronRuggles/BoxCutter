# BoxCutter
Open Source Large 2D CNC Cutter for making boxes. 

The goal of this repo is to explore the idea and interest of building a cheap, 2D, laser cutter/CNC router for making custom boxes on demand to address an issue faced by many ecommerce companies:

Problem: A customer orders a variety of products and different quantities of each product. You want to have the minimum dimensional weight, but also fit all of the items in the same box to allow for the the cheapest and least waistful shipping options.  
Looking for the right box, and buying a lot of variety of boxes is time consuming and imperfect.

Solution: If you have all your product size data (including padding data), which you likely do, since it is used with calculating shipping costs it could calculate the perfect box size/dimension and just cut the perfect box out for each and every order.

This then allows you to buy a pallet of corrugated cardboard sheets for cheaper than the vast amount of different boxes you'd need otherwise. 

This box cutter not only could cut the boxes but it could also maybe have a weight/roller drop down on it to crush it in places where the cardboard  needs to bend to make it easier to fold up & ship.

Dimensional weight is a pretty big issue too, so minimizing it is very important. Look at the cost increases for the three items described here: http://online-shipping-blog.endicia.com/beware-of-the-new-â€¦/

Boxes do not need to be cut very accurately, so it should be very cheap to build such a large 2D CNC Router. 

//////Bad idea since it requires it to be very accurate and would increase the cos///The software that corresponds to this machine could also etc/burn the shipping label directly onto the box shortly after the box as been cut out - so despite the initial cost of such a machine, it would also save on the labor and expenses when it comes to shipping lables. A company logo could be added easily as well. 

The cheapest way to build it would be like an etch-a-sketch with two stepper motors: https://youtu.be/ulblySFElo4?t=1m24s
